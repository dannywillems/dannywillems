### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I am Danny Willems. I am a mathematician with multiple interests, mostly related to computer sciences and theoretical physics.

I spend most of my time trying to provide a better Internet for everyone. With this mission in mind, I co-founded [LeakIX](https://leakix.net) with [Gregory Boddin](https://github.com/gboddin/) in 2021 and we aim to be the Internet red team.

I am also a senior cryptography engineer at [o1Labs](https://o1labs.org/), a company catalyzing a new generation of applications powered by zero-knowledge cryptography.

Previously I was a cryptography engineer at [Nomadic Labs](https://nomadic-labs.com) in the [cryptography team](https://research-development.nomadic-labs.com/files/cryptography.html) working on privacy preserving technologies.
I was also the first engineer at [B2C2](https://b2c2.com).

During my study, I did an internship in the [Gallium team at INRIA](https://gallium.inria.fr/) for my master thesis titled "To a typed language for modular programming" which consisted on unifying the core and modular language of OCaml.

I graduated with a master degree in Mathematics from the University of Mons in 2017.

Over the years, I also gained experiences in web and mobile development, DevOps and project managemenent.

My current interest in cryptography is incrementally verifiable computation. I have been also interested in arithmetization-oriented cryptographic primitives. On my free-time I read about cybersecurity, low-level code optimisations, formal verification and mathmetics applied in physics. I also enjoy doing recreative mathematics.

Regarding my personality, I am a curious person, I appreciate debating respectfully. I enjoy being surrounded by self-minded and respectful people, but I need to be in my world more than the average.
